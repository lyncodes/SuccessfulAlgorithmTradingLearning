# Event Driving Engine
## Components
- Event
  - the most fundamental unit of the event
  - it contains the type(such as "MARKET","SIGNAL","ORDER","FILL")
  - the event type determines how the event will be processed inside the **event-loop**
- Event Queue
  - In-Memory python Queue object that stores all Event which generated by the rest parts
  of the trading system
  - (_maybe in larger system, it can has several Queue for different purpose._)
- Data Handler
  - abstract base class
  - for handle both the **living market data** and the **historical data**
  - datahandler generates new MarketEvent every **heartbeat** of the system
- Strategy
  - also the ABC for both handling the living market data and historical backtesting
  - generating the SignalEvent
  - SignalEvent contains the **ticker symbol,trading direcion(LONG,SHORT),timestamp,and other extensieve** purpose
- Portfolio
  - takes **SignalEvents** from the **Queue** and generates **OrderEvents** that get added to the Queue.
- Execution Handler
  - take OrderEvents,then simulated it or send it to the living brokerage
  - once the orders are executed, the handler will generate the FillEvent
  - FillEvent contains the information:
    - what was actually transacted
    - transaction fees
    - commission
    - slippage
- Backtest
  - simulated things above
  
## Event
4 types basic event type including  **MarketEvent, SignalEvent, OrderEvent and FillEvent.**

``Event``
the base Event class for inherited
```python
class Event(object):
    """
    Event is base class,which will be inherited in the latter specified deritive 
    Event
    """
    pass
```
``MarketEvent``
derive from the base event class
```python
class MarketEvent(Event):
    """
    triggered by the datahandler which recieve data feed from vendor
    trigger the strategy to generating trading strategy
    """
def __init__(self):
"""
Initialises the MarketEvent.
"""
    self.type = 'MARKET'

```
